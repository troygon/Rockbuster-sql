## Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that have stores around the world and trying to enter the streaming services to rival Netflix and Amazon Prime. Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launce this online video rental service to stay competitive.

As the data analyst, I would be helping them to launch a strategy for new online video services. To answer questions from different departments, I will be getting the data from the huge data library that they have via SQL. I will be needing to gather the information needed and arrive at the conclusion to inform the management team correct market insights to help boost their sales and help the marketing capture a big market share.


## Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:

1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customes with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
